# single-perceptron-and-adaline

1. Implementation of single-layer perceptron from scratch
2. Implementation of Adaline algorithm using MSE from scratch


Using the Dry beans data in both your training and testing processes. 
(Each class has 50 samples: trained the NN with 30 non-repeated samples randomly selected, and tested it with the remaining 20 samples)
